    <h1 class="heading-3">Our new contract</h1>
    <p>
      On December 5, 2025, 98% of our union voted YES to ratify
      a new collective bargaining agreement. Kickstarter United bargained
      for over 7 months and undertook a historic 42 day long strike in order to
      secure vital new protections and benefits that we hope will not only
      improve the lives of our members, but will also serve as an inspiration to
      working people everywhere. All of these wins also come in addition to
      the benefits from our first contract, with no major concessions from the union.

      Some of the improvements we won in this new contract include:
