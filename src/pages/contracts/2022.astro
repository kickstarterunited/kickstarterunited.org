    <h1 class="heading-3">Our first contract</h1>
    <p>
      It’s official! On June 17th, 2022, 97.6% of our union voted YES to ratify
      our first collective bargaining agreement. This contract will improve our
      members' lives, make Kickstarter a more equitable workplace, and help
      raise standards across the tech industry. We fought hard for a contract
      that prioritizes security and wellness amidst rising inflation,
      uncertainty, and burnout. With this contract, we were able to secure the
      following:
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>💰 A guaranteed minimum 3% annual cost of living raise.</li>

        bands.
      </li>
      <li>
        📈 A profit-sharing bonus pool so that when Kickstarter thrives, we all
        benefit.

          alt={`"The tech industry is an unpredictable and rapidly changing one, and having certain guarantees about pay, fair treatment, and even potentially severance makes me feel a lot more stable. Knowing what to expect with your pay over the next few years, what you're guaranteed in case of layoffs, and even knowing what your bonus scheme will be or how much time off you'll receive give me that many fewer things to worry about. On top of all that, the addition of fairness clauses like not paying some people less because of where they live and having regular pay equity reviews lessen my worry that some people will be mistreated."

We're habituated to the idea that contractors might replace you as soon as the winds change, or that a years-long lawsuit is your only recourse for an unjust firing. But if you and your coworkers speak with a unified voice you will be heard. We did, and we won things like limits on contracting and a transparent process geared toward early intervention to counteract retaliation.” Luke Thomas, Bargaining Committee & Senior Software Engineer @ Kickstarter since December 2019`}

For me, the contract is a reminder that fair labor practices are vital across all industries—not everyone in tech is an engineer, and not every engineer is paid equally. It's a relief to feel like there is a mutual effort from Kickstarter's workers and leadership to be transparent, and to treat one another with respect and fairness. This has been an inspiring process." Liishi Durbin, Software Engineer @ Kickstarter since January 2022`}

It provides accountability for a lot of processes that previously lacked any sense of progress or accountability. What I hope it means for the industry-at-large is that you don't have to wait until something bad happens to organize, that you can use a collective bargaining agreement to lock in the already excellent but sometimes ephemeral benefits of your workplace. And finally, that there's space to think differently about retention over longer periods of time, hopefully giving employees a reason to stay and build seniority and institutional knowledge.” Dannel Jurado, Bargaining Committee & Senior Software Engineer @ Kickstarter since March 2019`}

It is really powerful to have colleagues and a company work together for your experience to be a positive one for years to come, to have a right at the individual contributor level to have a voice in that - an experience that so few workers expect. I genuinely think that the contract will attract people to Kickstarter and make them stay longer" Brooke McDaniel, Marketing Automation Manager @ Kickstarter since August 2021`}
