        Today will be the last day at Kickstarter for many of our colleagues
        impacted by COVID-19 layoffs.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the next week, we&#39;ll be sharing our thoughts, feelings, and stories
        about building the first union in the tech industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let&#39;s say it together: every worker needs a union! üó£Ô∏è

      alt="This experience has shown me that unions are the only way to have a true voice in your workplace. Being a part of the Kickstarter union has showed me what being truly accounted for looks like‚Äîwhat being truly listened to and heard feels like. Having the ability to come together and win a safe severance package will never be lost on me. Tech needs unions now more than ever."

      alt="A company may be run by kind, caring, thoughtful folks, but in the end‚Äîin a global pandemic in the worst economic recession since the Depression‚Äîthey won't have your back. They never did. Your fellow workers will. The joy I feel knowing we came together to ensure a fair severance package for all is some of the only joy I've felt in weeks. The gratitude I have for my coworkers and comrades is endless."

      alt="Those with power like to prescribe the borders of our imagination so that we believe there is no alternative to the system we‚Äôre living under. But solidarity and labor organizing show us a way out. They disrupt dominant narratives and rebuild our collective values from the ground up, letting us envision and enact the future we want to be a part of."

    <Image
      alt="Working with Kickstarter United was eye-opening. If you think your white-collar tech company's leadership has your back, and you don't need a union, I'd like to tell you that you're wrong. Even the best-intentioned companies will gut their ranks to survive. Unions are the only way to ensure a company will put its people over its capitalistic agenda. They're also a lesson in collaborative leadership, mutual aid, and resiliency. Starting a union is a way to fast-track your education around how resilient, mutually beneficial organizations can exists in this world. It's worth the effort."

Even in those moments, I thought ‚ÄúWell, this was worth fighting for.‚Äù And then we kept working, kept talking to our colleagues, weathering the blows and meeting misinformation with truth. And then...we won."

    <Image
      alt="In times of crisis, even the most mission-driven companies, organizations, and non-profits will put their survival first above workers' health and livelihoods. Before this I optimistically thought a company would do the right thing for at-risk workers in need, but it was my fellow workers via the union who fought for and won the protections, healthcare, and severance we now have heading into this economic depression."

But when when you talk to your colleagues, the isolation disappears and everything becomes possible. Share your story, build power, protect one another."

No matter what your workplace is like, I promise you‚Äôll feel better with a union and knowing your colleagues have your back."
