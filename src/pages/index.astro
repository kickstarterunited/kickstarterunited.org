      On September 26, 2025,
      <strong>85% of Kickstarter United (OPEIU Local 153) members</strong>
      <strong>voted to authorize a strike</strong>
      beginning Thursday, October 2 at 8 a.m. unless management reaches a fair contract
      agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Our demands are simple:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Protect the 32-hour, 4-day workweek that‚Äôs been in place for over three
        years.
      </li>
      <li>
        Establish a minimum salary that provides a livable wage for all workers.
      </li>
    </ul>

          <div>
            <p>
              At the bargaining table, Kickstarter management keeps passing the
              buck, claiming they can‚Äôt codify the 4-day work week because ‚Äúthey
              don‚Äôt own the company.‚Äù So we went straight to the board.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many board members have built careers around innovative, socially
              driven business models and Kickstarter was chartered as a PBC to
              meaningfully commit to those values. We felt the board should know
              management‚Äôs actions at the table don‚Äôt align with that ethos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their response? A brief dismissal of our concerns and a rejection
              of our invitation to the table.
            </p>
            <p>
              We implore the board to do the right thing and marry their actions
              to their words by supporting our cause.

    </h2>
    <p>
      In July of 2025 we began bargaining with the management at Kickstarter for
      our second union contract (our
      <a href="/contracts/2022"> first contract</a>
      was won in 2022). From the outset we have been clear with management that our
      top priorities are codifying the
      <strong id="4dww-defn">4-day, 32-hour work week (4DWW)</strong>
      as the standard and
      <strong>raising the minimum salary</strong>
      for all members of the bargaining unit. While we are proud of the progress
      we have made in some areas, management
      <em>continues to block real progress</em>
      on the
      <span aria-labelledby="4dww-dfn">4DWW</span>
      and fair minimum salaries.
