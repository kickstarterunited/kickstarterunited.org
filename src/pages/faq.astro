        <dt>What is Kickstarter United?</dt>
        <dd>
          Kickstarter United is the union that represents the employees of
          Kickstarter, PBC. We are part of
          <a href="https://www.opeiulocal153.org/"> OPEIU Local 153</a>
          and are also associated with
          <a href="https://www.techworkersunion-1010.org/">

        <dt>How does the 4-day work week (4DWW) work at Kickstarter?</dt>
        <dd>
          Kickstarter embarked on a 4DWW 32 hour pilot in April of 2022. The
          premise of that pilot can be summarized by 100-80-100. That means 100%
          of the work is completed in 80% of the time for 100% of the pay. The
          important piece is that 100% of the work is getting done in less time.
          Same work done = same pay.
        </dd>
        <dt>Has the 4DWW been a success?</dt>
        <dd>
          Kickstarter management sure thinks so - they’ve talked about it
          extensively over the years - and we workers agree! Our output has
          remained the same but our work life balance has improved immensely and
          it’s been a great recruiting tool for the company. Some folks even
          took pay cuts to come work a 4-day work week at Kickstarter.

        <dt>
          So what’s the sticking point on the 4DWW in contract negotiations?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Management wants to retain the right to both temporarily and
            permanently alter our work schedule back to a 5-day, 40-hour work
            week. We’ve offered several proposals that allow for the occasional
            and temporary need to shift schedules, but so far these have all
            been rejected. Management claims that flexibility must extend to the
            ability to permanently increase our working hours, despite operating
            successfully on a 4DWW for 3 years, because they can’t foresee what
            challenges the business will face.
          </p>
          <p>
            They would want us to retain our increased productivity that we
            gained from the 4DWW, but while working longer hours again,
            essentially trying to have us do 125% of the work we were doing
            prior to the 4DWW being implemented, but with no extra pay or time
            off.
