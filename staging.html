      <p>For the past ten years, Kickstarter’s employees have served creators and their communities in a mission to bring creative projects to life. Today, the people who deliver on Kickstarter's mission stand united — we invest in our future at the workplace we love.</p>

      <p>In 2015, Kickstarter re-incorporated as a Public Benefit Corporation. This decision radically reinvisioned Kickstarter’s institutions and offered a new path forward. In doing so, Kickstarter recognized that our responsibility extends well beyond shareholders.</p>

      <p>In Kickstarter’s words, our PBC “hard-codes [Kickstarter’s mission] at the deepest level possible to guide us, and future leaders of Kickstarter.” United, we take our seat among those leaders and take the steps necessary to guarantee our lasting impact on creators and communities alike.</p>

      <p><strong>Kickstarter United and Our Mission</strong></p>

      <p>Guaranteeing a lasting impact for our creators and their communities is a goal that we all share; each of us work to safeguard and enrich Kickstarter’s charter commitments to creativity, equity, and a positive impact on society. All of our voices help protect what’s great about Kickstarter and improve what isn’t. That’s why our union’s focus is on all the people who build Kickstarter.</p>

      <p>Unionizing offers all of us rights in the workplace for the very first time — this is central to achieving our mission: <em>protecting and empowering each and every employee at Kickstarter so that we can do our work to its fullest and continue to deliver a lasting impact</em>.</p>

      <p>Our union hard-codes our shared values into everything that we do: inclusion and solidarity, transparency and accountability; a seat at the table. Together, we turn toward collective bargaining in order to deliver on these values, win rights at the workplace, and preserve them. </p>

      <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Equitable compensation across all positions, creating equal pay for equal work.</li>
        <li>Diversity and inclusion in our hiring, professional growth, and product.</li>
        <li>A fair and transparent process when disciplinary action is taken; due process for all.</li>
        <li>Consistent reviews built on clear job expectations and objective performance metrics.</li>
        <li>Clearly defined and consistently implemented policies that are applied equally to all.</li>
        <li>Policies that prioritize employee wellness, safety, and mental health.</li>
        <li>Preserving a company culture that fosters a sense of community in the workplace.</li>
        <li>The proactive inclusion of employees in company-wide decisions that affect us all.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Kickstarter is an idea and an institution whose success in the service of creators and their communities is made possible by all of us. These are the basics we need in order to do that work, and these basics should be guaranteed by a contract. In our next decade, we believe Kickstarter’s mission is more important than ever. As we deliver on that mission, it’s time to protect the progress we’ve made together and create the long-lasting workplace we all deserve.</p>

      <p>That’s why we’re unionizing with OPEIU (Office and Professional Employees International Union) Local 153. Through collective bargaining and a contract we achieve our mission: protecting and empowering each and every employee at Kickstarter. </p>

      <p>Kickstarter has a clear path toward future success — it begins with us standing united.</p>
