        <p class="paragraph">On February 18th, 2020, Kickstarter employees voted to form a union, becoming the first major  tech company in the United States to do so. We took this step in order to invest deeply in our collective future at the company we love, to create a workplace that is safer and more equitable for all, and to support organizing efforts across the tech industry and the many creative communities our work touches. We are proud to call ourselves members of OPEIU Local 153. 
</p>
        <p>There is nowhere better-suited than Kickstarter to understand the elation of completing a successful campaign while knowing that the real work is still ahead. As we begin bargaining our first contract, we will remain true to the values that informed our organizing: transparency, inclusion, solidarity, accountability, and joy.</p>
        
        <p>The pillars around which we organized include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Equitable compensation across positions, creating equal pay for equal work.</li>
          <li>Diversity and inclusion in every aspect of the company.</li>
          <li>Fair, transparent, and consistently implemented processes around hiring, firing, professional growth, and   disciplinary action.</li>
           <li>Policies that prioritize employee wellness, safety, and mental health.</li>
          <li>The preservation of a company culture that fosters a sense of community and collaboration throughout the workplace.</li>
          <li>The proactive inclusion of employees in company-wide decisions that affect us all.</li>

          
          
        </ul>
        <p>Since its founding, Kickstarter has been a progressive, forward-thinking corporate player. In 2015, the company was reincorporated as a Public Benefit Corporation. This framework recognizes that our responsibility extends well beyond shareholders, committing us as a company to the pursuit of just, responsible, and equitable business practices. We believe that unionizing furthers these aims, while also allowing us to advocate for workers’ rights, which is an inherent aspect of fighting inequality. Utilizing workers’ collective power to improve our workplace is a natural extension of Kickstarter’s mission, encouraging every employee to safeguard and enrich our charter commitments to creativity, equity, and a positive impact on society. </p>

              <h5>01) What is OPEIU?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>OPEIU (Office and Professional Employees International Union) is a labor union with a focus on
                  organizing office workers and other professional laborers. Kickstarter is organizing with OPEIU Local
                  153, which operates in the NY/NJ/CT tri-state area.</p>

              <h5>02) What are the workplace improvements Kickstarter United is seeking?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>Kickstarter United will be made up of all employees in the bargaining unit and, as such, we will work
                  together once the union is ratified to propose improvements that are decided upon together. That said,
                  these values will be among the terms we will seek to solidify in a strong union contract:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Equitable compensation across all positions, creating equal pay for equal work.</li>
                  <li>Diversity and inclusion in hiring, professional growth, and product development.</li>
                  <li>A fair and transparent process when disciplinary action is taken; due process for all.</li>
                  <li>Consistent reviews built on clear job expectations and objective performance metrics.</li>
                  <li>Clearly defined and consistently implemented policies that are applied equally to everyone.</li>
                  <li>Policies that prioritize employee wellness, safety, and mental health.</li>
                  <li>The preservation of a company culture that fosters a sense of community in the workplace.</li>
                  <li>The proactive inclusion of employees in company-wide decisions that affect us all.</li>

              <h5>03) How does an NLRB election work?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>An NLRB election is a process used to determine whether a majority of employees wish to be
                  represented by a union.</p>
                <p>In order to conduct an election, 30% of eligible employees must sign a petition (or a union card)
                  expressing interest in forming a union.</p>
                <p>A secret ballot election is conducted by the NLRB at the workplace once a bargaining unit has been
                  agreed to.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>04) Who is eligible to vote?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>See the Notice of Election (posted on the KSR bulletin board and emailed to all employees) for a list
                  of eligible job titles, and all details related to election timing and location.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>05) Where are we voting?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>On-site voting will take place at the Kickstarter office. Eligible US-based remote employees will be
                  able to cast their ballots by mail.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>06) When are mail ballots due back?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>Mail ballots must be received by the Region 29 labor board no later than three weeks from the date of
                  the election.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>07) What if I’m out sick or on FMLA or PTO on the day of the election? Are there absentee ballots?
              </h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>No. The National Labor Relations Board does not allow absentee voting under any circumstances. If you
                  are not a full-time remote employee, you must show up in person to cast your ballot.&nbsp;</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>08) Who will oversee the election?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>The National Labor Relations Board will conduct this secret ballot election. Both Kickstarter United
                  and SOT will each select one non-supervisory, non-managerial employee to observe the election
                  alongside the NLRB.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>09) How many votes does it take to officially form a union?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>It takes a majority (50% +1 vote) of those who vote to win our election.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>10) What happens next if the vote passes? How do contract negotiations work?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>If the vote passes, we will have won the right to negotiate a legally binding contract that secures
                  our rights at work. The first step in that process is that all members of the bargaining unit will
                  elect a bargaining committee and commence contract negotiations. That committee, with the help of a
                  seasoned representative from OPEIU, will work with SOT to negotiate a contract, soliciting and
                  incorporating feedback from union members throughout the process.<br></p>
                <p>Once KSRU and SOT come to an agreement, every member of the bargaining unit will have the opportunity
                  to vote on the contract. Only then—when the contract is finalized, voted on, and ratified—will the
                  bargaining unit begin to pay dues. The average length of a union employment contract is around three
                  years.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>11) What are union dues, and how much are they?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>Dues are $48.50 per month. No one will pay anything until after the final contract is voted on by the
                  bargaining unit and signed.</p>
                <p>Union dues ensure that all members have the resources to negotiate strong contracts and have access
                  to legal support. Local unions rely on union dues to represent members and handle any issues that
                  arise.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="w-dyn-item">
              <h5>12) Are there legal repercussions to organizing a union?</h5>
              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p>When organizing a union, employees are protected under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935
                  (NLRA).</p>
