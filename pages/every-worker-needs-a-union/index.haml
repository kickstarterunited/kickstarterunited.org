      <img width="640" alt="This experience has shown me that unions are the only way to have a true voice in your workplace. Being a part of the Kickstarter union has showed me what being truly accounted for looks like‚Äîwhat being truly listened to and heard feels like. Having the ability to come together and win a safe severance package will never be lost on me. Tech needs unions now more than ever." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/01@3x.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="My severance is far more than other jobs' stock options got me. Solidarity > stock market." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/02@3x.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="A company may be run by kind, caring, thoughtful folks, but in the end‚Äîin a global pandemic in the worst economic recession since the Depression‚Äîthey won't have your back. They never did. Your fellow workers will. The joy I feel knowing we came together to ensure a fair severance package for all is some of the only joy I've felt in weeks. The gratitude I have for my coworkers and comrades is endless." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/04@3x.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="Empowering each other is gorgeous. Unions are us. I believe in us." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/05@3x.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="Your boss will never have your back like a union will." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/06 copy 2@3x.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="Those with power like to prescribe the borders of our imagination so that we believe there is no alternative to the system we‚Äôre living under. But solidarity and labor organizing show us a way out. They disrupt dominant narratives and rebuild our collective values from the ground up, letting us envision and enact the future we want to be a part of." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/06@3x.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="A union brings power balance to the workplace. People over profit!" src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/07@3x.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="To know that you‚Äôre not the only one who believes positive change is possible, while feeling supported in using your voice as part of a collective to achieve that change." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/08@3x.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="My dream job paid 10% less than my male counterpart. HR & my manager told me we were on "different career trajectories." My coworkers told me the truth‚Äîit was the pay gap. Alone I had no real power. As a union, we organized against inequity. It's night and day." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_01.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="Here‚Äôs one thing the bosses will never tell you: YOU are the union. You and your peers get to decide what your union values, what your union fights for, and how your union makes those decisions." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_02.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="Google ‚Äúfist of five.‚Äù Then compare that process to how decisions get made at your workplace. Really makes you think..." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_03.png"></img><br />

      <img width="640" alt="No amount of friendship can make up for a fundamentally abusive and sexist workplace experience. (p.s. You can have friendships and your union! They are not mutually exclusive. you may have heard otherwise...)" src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_06.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="Working with Kickstarter United was eye-opening. If you think your white-collar tech company's leadership has your back, and you don't need a union, I'd like to tell you that you're wrong. Even the best-intentioned companies will gut their ranks to survive. Unions are the only way to ensure a company will put its people over its capitalistic agenda. They're also a lesson in collaborative leadership, mutual aid, and resiliency. Starting a union is a way to fast-track your education around how resilient, mutually beneficial organizations can exists in this world. It's worth the effort." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_07.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="Organizing with my colleagues showed me just how great our company *could* be." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_08.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="There were so many times I thought we‚Äôd made a fatal mistake, so many times I thought management had us beat. Even in those moments, I thought ‚ÄúWell, this was worth fighting for.‚Äù And then we kept working, kept talking to our colleagues, weathering the blows and meeting misinformation with truth. And then...we won." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_09.png"></img><br />
      <img width="640" alt="In times of crisis, even the most mission-driven companies, organizations, and non-profits will put their survival first above workers' health and livelihoods. Before this I optimistically thought a company would do the right thing for at-risk workers in need, but it was my fellow workers via the union who fought for and won the protections, healthcare, and severance we now have heading into this economic depression." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_10.png"></img><br />

      <img width="640" alt="At work, we‚Äôre taught that our salaries, performance reviews, benefits, experiences of harassment, etc. are private. We‚Äôre not supposed to share with anyone. But when when you talk to your colleagues, the isolation disappears and everything becomes possible. Share your story, build power, protect one another." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_12.png"></img><br />

      <img width="640" alt="You may find a company whose values align with yours, but as far as the owners are concerned, those values always come second to profit.

      <img width="640" alt="Maybe your work place is great. Maybe work is just work and you try not to get too worked up about it. Maybe your colleagues are like your family. Maybe you‚Äôve seen some fucked up shit and felt alone and unable to handle it. No matter what your workplace is like, I promise you‚Äôll feel better with a union and knowing your colleagues have your back." src="../images/every_worker_needs_a_union/FINAL_Every Worker_15.png"></img><br />
