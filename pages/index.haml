    %p
      In July of 2025 we began bargaining with the management at Kickstarter for our second union contract (our
      %a{href: "/contracts/2022"} first contract
      was won in 2022). From the outset we have been clear with
      management that our top priorities are codifying the
      %strong#4dww-defn 4-day, 32-hour work week (4DWW)
      as the standard and
      %strong raising the minimum salary
      for all members of the bargaining unit.
      While we are proud of the progress we have made in some areas,
      management
      %em continues to block real progress
      on the
      %span{"aria-labelledby": "4dww-dfn"} 4DWW
      and fair minimum salaries.

          %div
            %p
              At the bargaining table, Kickstarter management keeps passing the buck, claiming they can‚Äôt codify the 4-day work week because
              ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt own the company.‚Äù So we went straight to the board.
            %p
              Many board members have built careers around innovative, socially driven business models and Kickstarter was chartered as a PBC to meaningfully commit to those values.
              We felt the board should know management‚Äôs actions at the table don‚Äôt align with that ethos.
            %p
              Their response? A brief dismissal of our concerns and a rejection of our invitation to the table.
            %p
              We implore the board to do the right thing and marry their actions to their words by supporting our cause.
