  %h1 Our Next Contract
  %p.paragraph
    In July of 2025 we began bargaining with the management at Kickstarter for our second union contract (our
    %a{:href => "/contracts/2022", :style => "display: inline;"} first
    was won in 2022). From the outset we have been clear with
    management that our top priorities for this contract are codifying the
    %strong 4-day, 32-hour work week
    as the standard,
    %strong raising the minimum salary
    for all members of the bargaining unit, and
    %strong establishing protections against AI tools replacing workers.
    While we are proud of the progress we have made in some areas,
    management remains intransigent the issues of the 4-day work week and minimum salaries.

      %h3 Read our Appeal to the Board
      %p
        At the bargaining table, Kickstarter management keeps passing the buck, claiming they can’t codify the 4-day work week because
        “they don’t own the company.” So we went straight to the board.
      %p
        Many board members have built careers around innovative, socially driven business models and Kickstarter was chartered as a PBC to meaningfully commit to those values. 
        We felt the board should know management’s actions at the table don’t align with that ethos.
      %p
        Their response? A brief dismissal of our concerns and a rejection of our invitation to the table.
      %p
        We implore the board to do the right thing and marry their actions to their words by supporting our cause.

        Kickstarter United members discussing our our demands and our union.
