  %h3 Our Next Contract
  %p.paragraph
    In July of 2025 we began bargaining with the management at Kickstarter for our second union contract (our
    %a{:href => "/contracts/2022", :style => "display: inline;"} first
    was won in 2022). From the outset we have been clear with
    management that our top priorities for this contract are codifying the
    %strong 4-day, 32-hour work week
    as the standard,
    %strong raising the minimum salary
    for all members of the bargaining unit, and
    %strong establishing protections against AI tools replacing workers.
    While we are proud of the progress we have made in some areas,
    management remains intransigent the issues of the 4-day work week and minimum salaries.
